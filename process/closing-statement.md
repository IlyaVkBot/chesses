What is an appropriate approach? Let me read through the materials...

WELL. As I state in multiple places, it's not exactly a game where I went out of my way to pursue any real kind of research agenda outside the baseline activity of creating variations as a way to explore game design possibility space.

So, is there actually anything much to say about Chesses? It's funny because it's the game with the largest response I've had in a while, but what is its content?

It's possibly a chance to say something about game as game design exercise, and particularly about the idea of presenting "game design itself" to a player, rather than a game per se? That was picked up nicely in at least one article, calling the game a "game design textbook" which I think is interesting and appealing? Suggests at least a little bit that people understand/welcome that as a concept?

It's a reminder that making games can actually be fun and satisfying???

The question of whether there's something of a disjunction between making entertaining games and making interesting/research-y games? I don't think that's true though so maybe not

Making the game itself was largely a matter of brainstorming a bunch of versions and then editing (e.g. the whole thing of a bunch of games going by the way side as I guess I settled into the specific "style" that I wanted the different games to follow - a sort of formal style in a lot of ways? With gravity and momentum the most eccentric?)

So I could write a bit about that brainstorming + editing process.

Then there was just the technical act of making them, which is an interaction between my coding and the libraries.

There was a bit of UI stuff which was boring but necessary.

And there was the reception, including bug-finding, which was great, but perhaps not very educational?

And then there's the larger framing idea of "game as game design" or something, which I've of course done multiple times in the past but maybe haven't actually written about anywhere, so could be worth mentioning?
