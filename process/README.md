This is just to say that I have officially made a folder for _Chesss_ and plan to type up the variations that were in my notebook in here in a moment if there's time before dinner? Let's see!

### 4:33 of Chess

I guess this is either than after 4:33 the game abruptly ends, possibly without you being able to move. Alternatively you need to specifically not do anything (not move the mouse etc.) for 4:33 for the performance of the game to complete. Any movement causes you to lose.

### Realtime Slow Motion / SUPER HOT CHESS?

You can move whenever you want to but the pieces take a long time to get to where they're going so you have to remember where they're headed? Seems complicated. It's a bit like Flight Control? Big question aruond two players here. Any kind of AI may well be a nightmare unless I write some kind of basic three move look-ahead?

### Loving / Sex Chess

When you capture a piece it generates a new piece instead, halfway between the parents, or on a square next to one of the parents. It could be a grey piece, in which case those pieces would then become a third player in the game? What happens if a grey piece mates with a black or white piece? Ad infinitum? Just continues to add new kinds of pieces? Is there a reason why they should be segregated into different teams and fighting? Or either person can move the grey pieces...

### Merging Chess

As above but when you capture the two pieces become a single grey piece which either player can choose to move. Would have to consider what properties that piece would have - is it a hybrid with the movement possibilities of both? Would does it look like??

### Clone Wars

Moving a piece leaves a copy behind. (Note that this would make it impossible for all back rank pieces to move except knights)

### Big Chess

Chess on a board with more than 64 squares, possibly with things like fog of war. How do you choose the pieces? Maybe it's still 8 wide, but just super long? If you play into the fog of war you might get stuck on a piece that you couldn't see?

### Wall

There's a wall in the middle of the board that pieces can't move past. Conceivably have a door? A series of rooms? (Starts sounding like Chogue...)

### Art

Pieces leave a line behind them showing where they've been. Maybe it fades.

### Fog of War

Separately from Big Chess you could implement a fog of war based on what pieces can see. I guess a piece can see as far as it can move?

### 'Tank' Chess?

Movement is time based - you have to drive the piece along its path within the time limit...

### Everyone Gets to Play

You can only move a piece after you've moved all your other pieces - they have a cool-down. This would mean you'd have to move all your pieces in order. Could make the cooldown less severe, too.

### Music Chess

Board as tone grid, piece styles as instruments... different positions have different sounds...

### Foley Chess

Don't love this right now, but you record foley for how each piece sounds when it moves (and captures)

### Art Chess 2

Draw the pieces before you start playing. Some potential advantage to confusing your opponent in terms of which piece is which here, which is interesting... but at the risk of confusing yourself.

### Voice Recognition CHess

Pretends to listen to you making a move, then does something else randomly?

### Up Close and Personal

Pieces all start right in front of each other at the middle of the board...

### Gravity Chess

Could be sideways, but could also just be the regular orientation (that might even be better in terms of formal structure). The pieces fall vertically down. Presumably this is an advantage for black? Who would be able to queen more easily? (White can't queen at all...)

### Angry Chess Birds

Angry birds style movement? Launch pieces at each other. Higher points pieces weigh more.

### HP Chess

Pieces have HP so a capture is more of an attack.

### Text Chess

Text adventure version of chess?

### Exploding Chess

Moved piece starts a timer (in turns). Explodes at end of timer with some blast radius (bigger for better pieces?) timer is reset if you move it again. Can still capture normally too?

### GPS Chess

Board laid out in physical space - 100x100m squares? Selection works based on where you are, then tap, then walk to where you want the piece to go.

### Momentum chess

Any move slides in its direction until stopped by another piece or the edge

... that's 23.
