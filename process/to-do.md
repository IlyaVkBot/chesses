## General

- Handle checkmate/stalemate/etc. in terms of some display and chance to restart
- Consider availability of PGN, but probably don't bother with it (who would care, how would it help?)

## MAD

- What happens when you capture with the king? I guess it gets removed and you lose immediately? Makes sense. Special case though.

## Pawns

## Swaps

- Eliminate moves that would place you in checkmate through swapping
- (Allow moves that wouldn't actually put you in checkmate through swapping? i.e. need to think about how swaps change the definition of a legal move?)
